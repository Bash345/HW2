Online University MAD30



A. Overview
============

In this project i will present a model for an online university ,there are four classes(entities) in my project:

1) Student : holds all students in the university.

2) Courses : holds all Courses taught at the university.

3) Instructor: holds all instructors in the university.

4) InstructorDetail: holds an additional information about each instructor in the university.



B. Relationships
=================
In this project i used all types of relationships between entities like one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many as following:-
s
one-to-one: the relationship between instructor and InstructorDetail is one-to-one which means that each instructor map to one instructorDetail and vice versa
here i used bidirectional mapping i.e from instructor i can get its instructorDetail and vice versa

one-to-many: the relationship between instructor and course is one-to-many which means that each instructor can teach many courses and at the same time
each course is maped or taught by only one instructor

many-to-one: the relationship between course and instructor is many-to-one which is the bidirectional relationship which descriped above

many-to-many: the relationship between student and course is many-to-many which means that each student can study or enroll in  many courses and at the same time
each course can be enrolled by many students. this relationship is broken by a junction table called "enrollments" which contains the primary key for each tables (student, course)



C. Associations(Attributes)
============================
in this section i will list the all fields for each class

1- Student ==>   id, fullName, level, list of enrolled courses.
2- Courses ==>   id, title, code, instructor of this course and list of all enrollments in this course(list of students).
3- Instructor==> id, fullName, instructorDetail object and list of all courses this instructor teach.
4- InstructorDetail==> id, phone  number, email and instructor itself(bidirectional).
